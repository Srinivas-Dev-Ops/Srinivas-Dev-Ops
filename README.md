Devops:
-------
1. Devops is not a new tool/technology in the market.
2. Its a new culture or process to develop, release and maintenance of software application/project/product with higher quality in very faster way.
3. We can achieve by using automation tools.

For any software product, two groups of engineers will work.
1. Development Group
2. Operations Group/Non-Development Group/ Administrators Group

Again this classification can be divided into small sets of groups.
Busines Analyst (BA)
System Analyst (SA)
Design Architect (DA)
Developers/coders
Build Engineer
Test Engineer/QA

1. Developmnt Group:
-----------------------
The people who are involved in 
1. Planning (requirement gathering and analysis)
2. Coding
3. Build
4. Testing
are considered as Development Group.  
eg:Busines Analyst (BA)
   System Analyst (SA)
   Design Architect (DA)
   Developers/coders
   Build Engineer
   Test Engineer/QA

 2. Operations Group:
 --------------------
 The people who are involved in

 1. Release
 2. Deployment
 3. Operations
 4. Monitoring
 are considered as Operations Group.
 eg:
 Configuration Engineer
 System Admin
 Database Admin
 Network Admin etc.,

Devops is a combination of development and Operations.
The main objective of devops is to implement collaboartion between development and operation teams.

To understand this new Devops culture, we have to be aware of already existing SDLC Models.
Software Development Life Cycle

1. Waterfall Model
2. Prototype Model
3. Incremental/Iterative Model
4. Spiral Model
5. RAD Model
6. Big-Bang Model
7. Fish Model
8. V Model
9. Agile Model
10. Devops Culture can be considered as a model


1. Waterfall Model
==================

Requirements Gathering/Collection
	Requirement Analysis
		Design
			Coding
				Testing
					Release
						Maintenance


Also known as Linear Sequential Model

Advantages:
-----------
1. It is very simple and easy to implement.
2. Best suitable if requirements are fixed.
3. Best suitable for small projects.


Limitations:
------------
1. Development time will increase
2. Cost of development will increase
3. It won't accept requirement changes in the middle
4. Client satisfaction is very low
5. Bug fixing is costly because we cannot identify bugs in early stages of life cycle
6. Not at all suitable if requiments keep on changing
7. Not suitable for large projects.

Agile Model:
------------
This was the most frequently used (in the last 10 years) and hot cake model in software development.
Agile model is divided into multiple sub models

1. Rational Unify Process (RUP)
2. Adaptive Software Development (ASD)
3. Feature Driven Development (FDD)
4. Crystal Clear
5. Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM)
6. Exteme Programming (XP)
7. SCRUM Model etc

Among all these models scrum model is most popular and frequently used model

Agile --> speed
Scrum is agile based model
It is not linear sequential model.
It is iterative model. Total software product will be developed increment by increment and each increment is called a sprint.

Continious delivery
Continious Feedback
Requirement changes in the middle
Client Satisfaction is very high
Less development time
Less devleopment cost

SCRUM is derived from rugby game.
sprint means small piece of work
In every sprint 7-9 members will work
each sprint will be delivered from one week to 3 weeks time

Why should we go for Devops?
---------------------------------
Devops and agile both are different models.

Similarities:
------------
1. Both are software development methodologies.
2. Both models concentrating on rapid software development with team collaboration.

Differences:
------------
1. The difference will come once development of the proejct completed.
Agile model talks about only development but not operations.
Devops model talks about complete product life cycle like development and operations.

2. In agile model, separate people are responsible for development, testing, deployment etc.,

But in devops, the devops engineer is responsible for everything like development to operations and operations to development.

deveops generalist

3. Agile model wont force us to use automation tools.
But devops model is completely based on automation.

4. Agile is always giving highest priority only for speed.
Devops giving the priority for both quality and speed.

5. In agile, client is responsible to give the feedback for the sprint.
But in devops, immediate feedback is available from the monitoring tools.

So what is Devops?
It is a new culture/process
It is the process of continious development, continious build, continious test, continious release of the software.
